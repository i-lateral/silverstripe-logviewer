Silverstripe Log Viewer module.
===============================

Log viewer is a module that should allow you to easily access recent server logs
through your Silverstripe CMS (rather than by squirreling away in your servers
log folder).

Install Instructions:
---------------------

1.  Upload the Silverstripe Log Viewer module to the "logviewer" folder in your
    SilverStripe root
2.  Run /dev/build/?flush=1
3.  Login to your administration panel (/admin): There should be a 'Logs' link
    available

Usage
-----

Once you have installed this module, you can add logs by adding the following to
your _config.php:

    LogAdmin::addLog($log_file_path,$path_type);

*$log_file_path* is the path to your log file (eg: /var/logs/apache2/error.log)
*$path_type* allows you to specify if the path is absolute ('a') or relative ('r')
if no type is specified, absolute is assumed.

Example:
--------

Using _ss_enviroment.php to manage logs in multiple locations with one install

In your _ss_enviroment.php file, add something like:

    define('APACHE_ERROR_LOG','/var/log/apache2/error.log');

Then in your _config.php, you can perform a check like this:

    if(defined('APACHE_ERROR_LOG'))
        LogAdmin::addLog(APACHE_ERROR_LOG);

This will then allow you to alter the constant 'APACHE_ERROR_LOG' on your
different environments, but not have to change your _config.php
